## üöÄ About

Computational workflows, which describe complex, multi-step procedures for automated execution, are essential for ensuring reproducibility, scalability, and efficiency in scientific research. The **FAIRagro Scientific Workflow Infrastructure (SciWIn)** supports scientists to create, execute, share, and publish these workflows, fostering collaboration and transparency.


Reproducibility in computational research is vital for efficient collaboration, verifying results and ensuring transparency. Yet it remains challenging due to complex workflows, inconsistent data management and the reliance on specific software environments. **SciWIn Client** is a command-line tool designed to easily create, record, annotate and execute computational workflows. SciWIn Client enables researchers to interactively use intuitive commands to keep track of tasks such as as data-extraction, -cleaning, -transformation, -analysis, -visualization and computational simulation. Automated and standardised workflows minimise sources of error and support transparent and reproducible Open Science.


## üèóÔ∏è How to Build and Test
This project is being developed using Rust and Cargo. To run the source code use `cargo run`, to build use `cargo build`. 

To run the tests use `cargo test` or `cargo test -- --nocapture` to output logs.

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/fairagro/m4.4_sciwin_client
cd m4.4_sciwin_client

# Build the project
cargo build

# Run the project
cargo run
```

To run tests (unit and integration)
```bash
cargo test --workspace           # Run all tests
cargo test -- --nocapture  # Show log output during tests
```

## üéØ Installation
Detailed installation instructions can be found at the [latest release](https://github.com/fairagro/m4.4_sciwin_client/releases/latest):

[![GitHub Release](https://img.shields.io/github/v/release/fairagro/m4.4_sciwin_client)](https://github.com/fairagro/m4.4_sciwin_client/releases/latest)

The easiest way is to use the `shell` or `powershell` scripts with the provided commands.
To install latests binaries you can use the following scripts:

### Linux/MacOS:
```bash
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -LsSf https://fairagro.github.io/m4.4_sciwin_client/get_s4n.sh | sh 
```

### Windows:
```powershell
powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -c "irm https://fairagro.github.io/m4.4_sciwin_client/get_s4n.ps1 | iex"
```

## üìö How to Use
Take a look at the **[User documentation](https://fairagro.github.io/m4.4_sciwin_client/)**. An overview on how to use SciWIn Client is available below.

### Project initialization
Most commands need the context of a Git repo to work. Project initialization can be done using the `s4n init` command.
```bash
s4n init -p <FOLDER/PROJECT NAME>
```
Besides the minimal project structure, the creation of an ["Annotated Research Context"](https://arc-rdm.org/) or ARC is also possible.
```bash
s4n init -a -p <FOLDER/PROJECT NAME>
```

### Creation of CWL CommandLineTools
To create [CWL](https://www.commonwl.org/) CommandLineTools which can be combined to workflows later a prefix command can be used. `s4n create` will execute any given command and creates a CWL CommandLineTool accordingly.
```bash
s4n create <COMMAND> [ARGUMENTS]
```
The command comes with a lot of different options on how to handle the CWL creation specifically.
```
Creates a new CWL File or Workflow

Usage: s4n create [OPTIONS] [COMMAND]...

Arguments:
  [COMMAND]...  Command line call e.g. python script.py [ARGUMENTS]

Options:
  -n, --name <NAME>                        A name to be used for this workflow or tool
  -c, --container-image <CONTAINER_IMAGE>  An image to pull from e.g. docker hub or path to a Dockerfile
  -t, --container-tag <CONTAINER_TAG>      The tag for the container when using a Dockerfile
  -r, --raw                                Outputs the raw CWL contents to terminal
      --no-commit                          Do not commit at the end of tool creation
      --no-run                             Do not run given command
      --clean                              Deletes created outputs after usage
      --no-defaults                        Removes default values from inputs
      --net                                Enables network in container
  -i, --inputs <INPUTS>                    Force values to be considered as an input.
  -o, --outputs <OUTPUTS>                  Force values to be considered as an output.
  -m, --mount <MOUNT>                      Mounts a directory into the working directory
  -f, --force                              Overwrites existing workflow
  -h, --help                               Print help

```

### Creation of CWL Workflows
CWL Workflows can be created semi-automatically using `s4n connect` commands. Connections to In- or Outputs are added using either `@inputs` or `@outputs` as file identifier.
```bash
s4n connect <NAME> --from [FILE]/[SLOT] --to [FILE/SLOT]
```
For example: `s4n connect demo --from @inputs/speakers --to calculation/speakers` - The Step `calculation` will be added pointing to `workflows/calculation/calculation.cwl`, which will use the newly created input `speakers` as input for its `speakers` input.

### Execution of CWL Files
SciWIn-Client comes with its custom CWL Runner (which does not support all `cwltool` can do, yet!) to run Workflows and CommandLineTools. The command `s4n execute local` can also be triggered using `s4n ex l`.
```bash
s4n execute local <CWLFILE> [ARGUMENTS]
```
