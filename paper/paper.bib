  abstract		= {The revalidation, reinterpretation and reuse of research data analyses requires having access to the original computing environment, the experimental datasets, the analysis software, and the computational workflow steps which were used by researchers to produce the original scientific results in the first place.REANA (Reusable Analyses) is a nascent platform enabling researchers to structure their research data analyses in view of enabling future reuse. The analysis is described by means of a YAML file that captures sufficient information about the analysis assets, parameters and processes. The REANA platform consists of a set of micro-services allowing to launch and monitor container-based computational workflow jobs on the cloud. The REANA user interface and the command-line client enables researchers to easily rerun analysis workflows with new input parameters. The REANA platform aims at supporting several container technologies (Docker), workflow engines (CWL, Yadage), shared storage systems (Ceph, EOS) and compute cloud infrastructures (Ku-bernetes/OpenStack, HTCondor) used by the community.REANA was developed with the particle physics use case in mind and profits from synergies with general reusable research data analysis patterns in other scientific disciplines, such as bioinformatics and life sciences.},

  abstract		= {Recording the provenance of scientific computation results is key to the support of traceability, reproducibility and quality assessment of data products. Several data models have been explored to address this need, providing representations of workflow plans and their executions as well as means of packaging the resulting information for archiving and sharing. However, existing approaches tend to lack interoperable adoption across workflow management systems. In this work we present Workflow Run RO-Crate, an extension of RO-Crate (Research Object Crate) and Schema.org to capture the provenance of the execution of computational workflows at different levels of granularity and bundle together all their associated objects (inputs, outputs, code, etc.). The model is supported by a diverse, open community that runs regular meetings, discussing development, maintenance and adoption aspects. Workflow Run RO-Crate is already implemented by several workflow management systems, allowing interoperable comparisons between workflow runs from heterogeneous systems. We describe the model, its alignment to standards such as W3C PROV, and its implementation in six workflow systems. Finally, we illustrate the application of Workflow Run RO-Crate in two use cases of machine learning in the digital image analysis domain.},
