# Summary
SciWIn-Client is a command-line tool developed as part of FAIRagro's Scientific Workflow Infrastructure (SciWIn). It is designed to streamline the creation, execution and management of reproducible computational Workflows using the Common Workflow Language (CWL).
SciWIn-Client allows researchers to create and modify CWL CommandLineTools and workflows with minimal amount of work. It supports local and remote workflow execution within containerized environments enabling consitent results across different systems.
By integrating with Git it promotes transparent and collaborative workflow development helping researchers to share their work in a reproducible and substainable way.

# Statement of Need
Computational workflows are used in many different disciplines to automate complex, multi-step data analysis procedures. To ensure reproducibility, scalability and efficiency in scientific research, lots of effort has been put into domain specific languages that formalize and standardize computational scientific work. The Common Workflow Language (CWL)[@Crusoe2022MethodsIncluded] is among the most powerful and established workflow languages. While CWL is an extremely flexible language, is also quite verbose.
