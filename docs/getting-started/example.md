# Example Project
This example is a sample use case for building a small project with `s4n`. It features the creation of two commandline scripts and the combination of those into a workflow as well as the execution of this workflow using the internal CWL runner.

## Prerequisites
Add `s4n` to your `PATH` environment variable if not done already. 
```bash
export PATH=$PATH:/path/to/your/s4n/executable
```

To verify the successful addition to the `PATH` variable the following command can be used.
```bash
s4n -V
# s4n 0.1.0
```

## Initialization
To initialize a new project use the `s4n init` command. A project folder can be specifies using the `-p` argument.
The command will initialize a git repository in this folder if there is none already. Furthermore a `workflows` folder will be created.
```bash 
s4n init -p test_project
# 📂 s4n project initialisation sucessfully:
# test_project (Base)
#   ├── workflows
```

For this example some data needs to be created. To download the data a new folder `data` needs to be created. The raw data files can be downloaded using e.g. `wget`.
```bash
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/fairagro/m4.4_sciwin_client/refs/heads/main/tests/test_data/hello_world/data/population.csv
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/fairagro/m4.4_sciwin_client/refs/heads/main/tests/test_data/hello_world/data/speakers_revised.csv
```

## Creation of Tools
The keep the demo project organized, the `workflows` folder will also be used to house the scripts used in this demo. The following bash script needs to be created as `workflows/calculation/calculation.py` 
```python
import argparse
import csv

def calculate_total_population(population_file):
    total_population = 0
    with open(population_file, 'r') as f:
        reader = csv.reader(f)
        next(reader) 
        for row in reader:
            try:
                total_population += int(row[1]) 
            except ValueError:
                print(f"Error: Invalid population value in {row[0]}")
                return None
    return total_population

def calculate_speaker_percentages(speakers_file, total_population):
    print("Language,Speakers,Percentage")
    with open(speakers_file, 'r') as f:
        reader = csv.reader(f)
        next(reader)
        for row in reader:
            try:
                language = row[0]
                speakers = int(row[1])
                percentage = (speakers / total_population) * 100
                print(f"{language},{speakers},{percentage:.2f}%")
            except ValueError:
                print(f"Error: Invalid speakers value in {row[0]}")

def main():
    parser = argparse.ArgumentParser(description='Calculate population-based percentages.')
    parser.add_argument('--population', required=True, help='CSV file containing population data')
    parser.add_argument('--speakers', required=True, help='CSV file containing speakers data')

    args = parser.parse_args()
    try:
        total_population = calculate_total_population(args.population)
        percentages = calculate_speaker_percentages(args.speakers, total_population)
        print(percentages)
    except FileNotFoundError as e:
        print(f"Error: File not found: {e.filename}")
        return

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

To run the tool creation command the changes need to be committed beforehand. The shell script usually would be called with the command `python workflows/calculation/calculation.py --speakers data/speakers_revised.csv --population data/population.csv \> results.csv`. To create a CommandLineTool this only needs to be prefixed with `s4n tool create` or `s4n run`. However the `>` operator needs to be escaped using a backslash.
```bash 
s4n tool create python workflows/calculation/calculation.py --speakers data/speakers_revised.csv --population data/population.csv \> results.csv
# 📂 The current working directory is /home/ubuntu/test_project
# ⏳ Executing Command: `python workflows/calculation/calculation.py --speakers data/speakers_revised.csv --population data/population.csv`
# 📜 Found changes:
#         - results.csv
# 
# 📄 Created CWL file workflows/calculation/calculation.cwl
```
This created CWL file should look like the following example:
```yaml
#!/usr/bin/env cwl-runner

cwlVersion: v1.2
class: CommandLineTool

requirements:
- class: InitialWorkDirRequirement
  listing:
  - entryname: workflows/calculation/calculation.py
    entry:
      $include: calculation.py

inputs:
- id: speakers
  type: File
  default:
    class: File
    location: '../../data/speakers_revised.csv'
  inputBinding:
    prefix: '--speakers'
- id: population
  type: File
  default:
    class: File
    location: '../../data/population.csv'
  inputBinding:
    prefix: '--population'

outputs:
- id: results
  type: File
  outputBinding:
    glob: results.csv
stdout: results.csv

baseCommand:
- python
- workflows/calculation/calculation.py
```

The `tool create` command created a description of the script which can be used to build workflows. In this example a second script will be used to have a linear two-step-workflow at the end (`matplotlib` needs to be installed beforehand!)

```python
import argparse
import csv
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

def generate_bar_plot(results_file):
    languages = []
    percentages = []
    with open(results_file, 'r') as f:
        reader = csv.reader(f)
        next(reader)
        for row in reader:
            language = row[0]
            percentage = float(row[2].replace('%', ''))  
            languages.append(language)
            percentages.append(percentage)

    plt.bar(languages, percentages)
    plt.xlabel('Language')
    plt.ylabel('Percentage of Total Population')
    plt.title('Language Speakers as Percentage of Total Population')
    plt.xticks(rotation=45)
    plt.tight_layout()    
    plt.savefig("figure.png")

def main():
    parser = argparse.ArgumentParser(description='Generate a bar plot from results.csv.')
    parser.add_argument('--data', required=True, help='CSV file containing the results data for bar plot')

    args = parser.parse_args()

    try:
        generate_bar_plot(args.data)
    except FileNotFoundError as e:
        print(f"Error: File not found: {e.filename}")
        return

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

To create the tool for this script the following command can be used to create the CWL definition. SciWIn client automatically determines that `figure.png` shall be listed as an output for this tool.
```bash
s4n tool create python workflows/plot/plot.py --data results.csv
# 📂 The current working directory is /home/ubuntu/test_project
# ⏳ Executing Command: `python workflows/plot/plot.py --data results.csv`
# 📜 Found changes:
#         - figure.png
# 
# 📄 Created CWL file workflows/plot/plot.cwl
```

The freshly created plot tool should look like this:
```yaml
#!/usr/bin/env cwl-runner

cwlVersion: v1.2
class: CommandLineTool

requirements:
- class: InitialWorkDirRequirement
  listing:
  - entryname: workflows/plot/plot.py
    entry:
      $include: plot.py

inputs:
- id: data
  type: File
  default:
    class: File
    location: '../../results.csv'
  inputBinding:
    prefix: '--data'

outputs:
- id: figure
  type: File
  outputBinding:
    glob: figure.png

baseCommand:
- python
- workflows/plot/plot.py
```

## Combining Tools to Workflows
To check that all has been created correctly the `list` command can be used to visualize tools and their in- and outputs.
```bash
s4n tool list -a
# 📂 Scanning for tools in: /home/ubuntu/test_project
# +-------------+----------------------------------------------+---------------------+
# | Tool        | Inputs                                       | Outputs             |
# +-------------+----------------------------------------------+---------------------+
# | plot        | plot/data                                    | plot/figure         |
# +-------------+----------------------------------------------+---------------------+
# | calculation | calculation/speakers, calculation/population | calculation/results |
# +-------------+----------------------------------------------+---------------------+
```

To execute those tools and to really benefit from using CWL a workflow can be created connecting the tools. To create a blank workflow file the 
```bash
s4n workflow create main
# 📄 Created new Workflow file: workflows/main/main.cwl
```

Connections between tools and in- and outputs can be created by the `connect` command. There are the two arguments `--from` and `--to` which creates a line from one node to another. Furthermore a workflow needs inputs and outputs to process its steps. The slot names can be copied from the aforementioned `s4n tool list` command, a connection to in. and outputs needs to be prefixed with `@` and will result in creation of a new in- oder output slot.

```bash
s4n workflow connect main --from @inputs/speakers --to calculation/speakers
# ➕ Added step calculation to workflow
# ➕ Added or updated connection from inputs.speakers to calculation/speakers in workflow
# ✔️  Updated Workflow workflows/main/main.cwl!
```

A report of the current status of the workflow can be received by using the `status` command. Doing this now will result in the following table. As it states there currently is no output and one input (`speakers`). The only step is the calculation step, which has the input connected to its `speakers` slot. The `population` slot would use its default value and nothing is done with the steps output `results`.
```bash
s4n workflow status main
# Status report for Workflow workflows/main/main.cwl
# +--------------------------------+------------------+---------------+
# | Tool                           | Inputs           | Outputs       |
# +================================+==================+===============+
# | <Workflow>                     | ✅    speakers   |               |
# +--------------------------------+------------------+---------------+
# | Steps:                         |                  |               |
# +--------------------------------+------------------+---------------+
# | ../calculation/calculation.cwl | ✅    speakers   | ❌    results |
# |                                | 🔘    population |               |
# +--------------------------------+------------------+---------------+
# ✅ : connected - 🔘 : tool default - ❌ : no connection
```

To connect another input to the `population` slot the above command can be reused with the neccessary adjustments. The stdout will be one line shorter now, as the step will not be created a second time.
```bash
s4n workflow connect main --from @inputs/population --to calculation/population
# ➕ Added or updated connection from inputs.population to calculation/population in workflow
# ✔️  Updated Workflow workflows/main/main.cwl!
```

As done before the result of the calculation step shall be used in the plot script. Therefore a connection between both steps is needed. The `s4n tool ls -a` command can be used to to copy and paste the slot names for this connection.
```bash
s4n workflow connect main --from calculation/results --to plot/data
# 🔗 Found step calculation in workflow. Not changing that!
# ➕ Added step plot to workflow
# ✔️  Updated Workflow workflows/main/main.cwl!
```

To complete the workflow a connection to an output is needed. Otherwise no file will be copied back after running the workflow.
```bash
s4n workflow connect main --from plot/figure --to @outputs/image
# ➕ Added or updated connection from plot/figure to outputs.image in workflow!
# ✔️  Updated Workflow workflows/main/main.cwl!
```

Running the status command again will show that everything is fine now!
```bash
s4n workflow status main
# Status report for Workflow workflows/main/main.cwl
# +--------------------------------+------------------+---------------+
# | Tool                           | Inputs           | Outputs       |
# +================================+==================+===============+
# | <Workflow>                     | ✅    speakers   | ✅    image   |
# |                                | ✅    population |               |
# +--------------------------------+------------------+---------------+
# | Steps:                         |                  |               |
# +--------------------------------+------------------+---------------+
# | ../calculation/calculation.cwl | ✅    speakers   | ✅    results |
# |                                | ✅    population |               |
# +--------------------------------+------------------+---------------+
# | ../plot/plot.cwl               | ✅    data       | ✅    figure  |
# +--------------------------------+------------------+---------------+
# ✅ : connected - 🔘 : tool default - ❌ : no connection
```

The finished CWL workflow file looks like this:
```yaml
#!/usr/bin/env cwl-runner

cwlVersion: v1.2
class: Workflow

inputs:
- id: speakers
  type: File
- id: population
  type: File

outputs:
- id: image
  type: File
  outputSource: plot/figure

steps:
- id: calculation
  in:
    population: population
    speakers: speakers
  run: '../calculation/calculation.cwl'
  out:
  - results
- id: plot
  in:
    data: calculation/results
  run: '../plot/plot.cwl'
  out:
  - figure
```

Use the save command to commit the workflow
```bash
s4n workflow save main
```

## Execution
The workflow now can be executed using a standard CWL runner like `cwltool` or using SciWIn-client's internal runner. SciWIn's internal runner is still in a testing phase so it will not be able to support all features `cwltool` does, but is does support everything the client can generate. CWL can either be executed by using commandline arguments or by using a input file in YAML format. For this demo the following input file (`inputs.yml`) is used:
```yaml
population:
  class: File
  location: data/population.csv
speakers:
  class: File
  location: data/speakers_revised.csv
```

Before running the workflow the output files of the script execution should be deleted to verify the correct execution. The workflow can be executed locally by using the following command which concludes this example.
```bash
s4n execute local workflows/main/main.cwl inputs.yml
# 💻 Executing "workflows/main/main.cwl" using SciWIn's custom runner. Use `--runner cwltool` to use reference runner (if installed).
