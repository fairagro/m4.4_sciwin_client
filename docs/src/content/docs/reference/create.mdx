## `create`
The `create` command can be used to easily generate CWL CommandLineTools. It serves as a prefix to the usual command line prompt. Calling `create` with a command attached will execute the command, determine in- and outputs and create a CWL tool definition file in the `workflows` folder. 

:::note
    Before using this command all changes need to be commited as it uses `git` to determine tool outputs!
    `git status` can be used to check beforehand.

:::tip
    Redirection `>` and pipes `|` can be used, but need to be escaped with a backslash fot the parser to use. Otherwise the console output of `s4n` will be redirected / piped.

    ```txt frame="terminal" title="Usage"
        Creates a new CWL File or Workflow

        Usage: s4n create [OPTIONS] [COMMAND]...

        Arguments:
          [COMMAND]...  Command line call e.g. python script.py [ARGUMENTS]

        Options:
          -n, --name <NAME>                        A name to be used for this workflow or tool
          -c, --container-image <CONTAINER_IMAGE>  An image to pull from e.g. docker hub or path to a Dockerfile
          -t, --container-tag <CONTAINER_TAG>      The tag for the container when using a Dockerfile
          -r, --raw                                Outputs the raw CWL contents to terminal
              --no-commit                          Do not commit at the end of tool creation
              --no-run                             Do not run given command
              --clean                              Deletes created outputs after usage
              --no-defaults                        Removes default values from inputs
              --net                                Enables network in container
          -i, --inputs <INPUTS>                    Force values to be considered as an input.
          -o, --outputs <OUTPUTS>                  Force values to be considered as an output.
          -m, --mount <MOUNT>                      Mounts a directory into the working directory
          -f, --force                              Overwrites existing workflow
          -h, --help                               Print help
    ```

:::tip[Example]
    The following command will create a CWL CommandLineTool description for executing a python script `echo.py` with a txt file as parameter `--test`.
    ```bash
    s4n create python echo.py --test input.txt
    ```
    The command will create this CWL file in the workflows folder.
    ```yaml
    #!/usr/bin/env cwl-runner

    cwlVersion: v1.2
    class: CommandLineTool

    requirements:
    - class: InitialWorkDirRequirement
      listing:
      - entryname: echo.py
        entry:
          $include: '../../echo.py'

    inputs:
    - id: test
      type: File
      default:
        class: File
        location: '../../input.txt'
      inputBinding:
        prefix: '--test'

    outputs:
    - id: results
      type: File
      outputBinding:
        glob: results.txt

    baseCommand:
    - python
    - echo.py
    ```

### Options
If only `--name` is given the command will create an empty workflow. However this is completely optional as the workflow will also be created upon the creating the first connection.

With the `--name` option the resulting filename can be manipulated. Without the argument SciWIn client will automatically generate a name based on the command. If for example the same base command is used in two tools there would be a file name conflict.

The two container options `--container-image` and `--container-tag` can be used to add Docker requirements to the resulting CWL file. However Docker will **NOT** be used to execute the script while generating the tool, so make sure to either use `s4n` in Docker container or provide all neccesary tools for it to run.

With the `--raw` flag no CWL file will be written to disk. Instead the raw cwl will be outputted to the command prompt (stdout) to process it further.

As `create` needs all changes to be commited beforehand it will create a commit after it completed the tool creation. To prevent that because e.g. manual changes to the CWL file have to be made before committing the `--no-commit` flag can be used.

Some scripts tend to run for a very long time - e.g. quantum chemistry calculations. To prevent the tool from running the `--no-run` flag can be used. If this flag is set the parser will just use information from the command line to create the tool, outputs need to be set manually.

Sometimes it can be beneficial to not commit the created outputs. With the `--clean` flag all outputs will be deleted before commiting the freshly created tool. 

Implicit in- and outputs can be added using `-i` or `-o`. ([See Examples](../examples/tool-creation.md#implicit-inputs-hardcoded-files))
