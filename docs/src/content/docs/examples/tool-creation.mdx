title: Tool creation
---

CWL command line tools can be created easily using `s4n`. The simplest approach is to just add the `s4n create` as prefix to the command.

A command line tool consists of a `baseCommand` which is usually any kind of executable which accepts `inputs` and writes `outputs`. In- and Outputs can be of multiple kinds of value type but Files are generally the most used kind. The `baseCommand` can be a single term like `echo` or a list like `[python, script.py]`. All of this is handle by SciWIn Client.

!!! note 
    The following examples assume that they are being executed in a git repository with clean status. If there is no repository yet, use `s4n init` to create an environment.

## Wrapping `echo`
A common example is to wrap the `echo` command for its simplicity. To create the tool `echo "Hello World"` is prefixed with `s4n create`.
    ```bash title="Command"
    s4n create echo "Hello World"
    ```
    ```yaml title="echo.cwl"
    #!/usr/bin/env cwl-runner

    cwlVersion: v1.2
    class: CommandLineTool

    inputs:
    - id: hello_world
      type: string
      default: Hello World
      inputBinding:
        position: 0

    outputs: []
    baseCommand: echo
    ```

The baseCommand was correctly determined as `echo` and an input slot was created named with the value of the input as slug `hello_world`. This could be renamed by editing the file, but for now we leave it as is. Currrently the tool is not producing any outputs. Assuming we want to create a file using the `echo` command which is a common use case a redirection `>` operator can be used. To not redirect the `s4n` output it needs to be shielded by a backslash `\>`.
Assuming the following `yaml` file needs to be created 
```yaml
message: "Hello World"
```
The usual command would be `echo 'message: "Hello World"' > hello.yaml`. To create the command line tool the command will be
    ```bash title="Command"
    s4n create --name echo2 echo 'message: "Hello World"' \> hello.yaml
    ```
    ```yaml title="echo2.cwl"
    #!/usr/bin/env cwl-runner

    cwlVersion: v1.2
    class: CommandLineTool

    inputs:
    - id: message_hello_world
      type: string
      default:
        message: Hello World
      inputBinding:
        position: 0

    outputs:
    - id: hello
      type: File
      outputBinding:
        glob: hello.yaml
    stdout: hello.yaml

    baseCommand: echo
    ```

The `stdout` part will tell the tool to redirect output to the file called `hello.yaml`. Noticed the `--name` option? This is used to specify the file name of the to be created tool.

## Wrapping a python script
A common usecase is to wrap a script in an interpreted language like python or R. Wrapping a python script follows the same principles like shown in the previous example where the `echo` command was wrapped.

    ```bash title="Command"
    s4n create --name echo_python python echo.py --message "SciWIn rocks!" --output-file out.txt
    ```
    ```python title="echo.py"
    import argparse;

    parser = argparse.ArgumentParser(description='Echo your input')
    parser.add_argument('--message', help='Message to echo', required=True)
    parser.add_argument('--output-file', help='File to save the message', required=True)

    args = parser.parse_args()

    with open(args.output_file, 'w') as f:
        f.write(args.message)
        print(args.message)
    ``` 
    ```yaml title="echo_python.cwl"
    #!/usr/bin/env cwl-runner

    cwlVersion: v1.2
    class: CommandLineTool

    requirements:
    - class: InitialWorkDirRequirement
      listing:
      - entryname: echo.py
        entry:
          $include: '../../echo.py'
      - class: InlineJavascriptRequirement

    inputs:
    - id: message
      type: string
      default: SciWIn rocks!
      inputBinding:
        prefix: '--message'
    - id: outputfile
      type: string
      default: out.txt
      inputBinding:
        prefix: '--output-file'

    outputs:
    - id: out
      type: File
      outputBinding:
        glob: $(inputs.outputfile)

    baseCommand:
    - python
    - echo.py
    ```

As shown in `echo_python.cwl` the `outputBinding` for the output file is set to `$(inputs.outputfile)` and therefore automatically gets the name given in the input. `s4n` also automatically detects the usage of `python` and adds the used script as an `InitialWorkDirRequirement` which makes the script available for the execution engine.

## Wrapping a long running script
Sometimes it is neccessary to run a highly complicated script on a remote environment because it would take to long on a simple machine. But how to get the CWL file than? In the example python file the script will sleep for 1 minute and then writes a file. One could use the `s4n create` command as shown above and just wait 60 seconds. But what if the calculation takes a week? This is possible for example in quantum chemical calculations like DFT.
There is the `--no-run` flag which tells `s4n` to not run the script. However this will not create an output and therefore can not detect any output files.

    ``` bash title="Command"
    s4n create --no-run python sleep.py
    ```
    ```python title="sleep.py"
    from time import sleep

    sleep(60)

    with open('sleep.txt', 'w') as f:
        f.write('I slept for 60 seconds')
    ```
    ```yaml title="sleep.cwl"
    #!/usr/bin/env cwl-runner

    cwlVersion: v1.2
    class: CommandLineTool

    requirements:
    - class: InitialWorkDirRequirement
      listing:
      - entryname: sleep.py
        entry:
          $include: '../../sleep.py'

    inputs: []
    outputs: []
    baseCommand:
    - python
    - sleep.py
    ```

For this cases there is the possibility to specify outputs via the commandline using the `-o` or `--outputs` argument which tells the parser to add a output slot.

    ``` bash title="Command"
    s4n create --name sleep2 --no-run -o sleep.txt python sleep.py
    ```
    ```yaml title="sleep2.cwl"
    #!/usr/bin/env cwl-runner
    
    cwlVersion: v1.2
    class: CommandLineTool
    
    requirements:
    - class: InitialWorkDirRequirement
      listing:
      - entryname: sleep.py
        entry:
          $include: '../../sleep.py'
    
    inputs: []
    outputs:
    - id: sleep
      type: File
      outputBinding:
        glob: sleep.txt
    
    baseCommand:
    - python
    - sleep.py
    ```

This CWL file can then be executed remotely by using any runner e.g. `cwltool` and will write the `sleep.txt` file after 60 seconds.

## Implicit inputs - hardcoded files
Like shown in the above example there is also the possibility to specify inputs explictly. This is needed e.g. if the scripts loads a hardcoded file like in the following example.

    ```bash title="Command"
    s4n create -i file.txt -o out.txt python load.py
    ```
    ```python title="load.py"
    with open('file.txt', 'r') as file:
        data = file.read()
        with open('out.txt', 'w') as out:
            out.write(data)
    ```
    ```yaml title="load.cwl"
    #!/usr/bin/env cwl-runner
    
    cwlVersion: v1.2
    class: CommandLineTool
    
    requirements:
    - class: InitialWorkDirRequirement
      listing:
      - entryname: file.txt
        entry:
          $include: '../../file.txt'
      - entryname: load.py
        entry:
          $include: '../../load.py'
    
    inputs: []
    outputs:
    - id: out
      type: File
      outputBinding:
        glob: out.txt
    
    baseCommand:
    - python
    - load.py
    ```

## Piping 
Using the pipe operator `|` is a common usecase when using the commandline. Let's assume the first 5 lines of a file are needed e.g `cat speakers.csv | head -n 5 > speakers_5.csv`

    ```bash title="Command"
    s4n create cat speakers.csv \| head -n 5 \> speakers_5.csv
    ```
    ```yaml title="cat.cwl"
       #!/usr/bin/env cwl-runner
       
       cwlVersion: v1.2
       class: CommandLineTool
       
       requirements:
       - class: ShellCommandRequirement
       
       inputs:
       - id: speakers_csv
         type: File
         default:
           class: File
           location: '../../speakers.csv'
         inputBinding:
           position: 0
       
       outputs:
       - id: speakers_5
         type: File
         outputBinding:
           glob: speakers_5.csv
       
       baseCommand: cat
       arguments:
       - position: 1
         valueFrom: '|'
         shellQuote: false
       - position: 1
         valueFrom: head
       - position: 2
         valueFrom: '-n'
       - position: 3
         valueFrom: '5'
       - position: 4
         valueFrom: '>'
       - position: 5
         valueFrom: speakers_5.csv
    ```


## Pulling containers
For full reproducibility it is recommended to use containers e.g. `docker` as requirement inside of the CWL files. Adding an existing container image is quite easy. The `s4n create` command needs to be called using `-c` or `--container-image` argument. For testing a python script using `pandas` is used together with the `pandas/pandas` container.


    ```bash title="Command"
    s4n create -c pandas/pandas:pip-all python calculation.py --population population.csv --speakers speakers_revised.csv
    ```
    ```python title="calculation.py"
    import pandas as pd
    import argparse
    
    parser = argparse.ArgumentParser(prog="python calculation.py", description="Calculates the percentage of speakers for each language")
    parser.add_argument("-p", "--population", required=True, help="Path to the population.csv File")
    parser.add_argument("-s", "--speakers", required=True, help="Path to the speakers.csv File")
    
    args = parser.parse_args()
    
    df = pd.read_csv(args.population)
    sum = df["population"].sum()
    
    print(f"Total population: {sum}")
    
    df = pd.read_csv(args.speakers)
    df["percentage"] = df["speakers"] / sum * 100
    
    df.to_csv("results.csv")
    print(df.head(10))
    ```
    ```yaml title="calculation.cwl"
    #!/usr/bin/env cwl-runner
    
    cwlVersion: v1.2
    class: CommandLineTool
    
    requirements:
    - class: InitialWorkDirRequirement
      listing:
      - entryname: calculation.py
        entry:
          $include: '../../calculation.py'
    - class: DockerRequirement
      dockerPull: pandas/pandas:pip-all
    
    inputs:
    - id: population
      type: File
      default:
        class: File
        location: '../../population.csv'
      inputBinding:
        prefix: '--population'
    - id: speakers
      type: File
      default:
        class: File
        location: '../../speakers_revised.csv'
      inputBinding:
        prefix: '--speakers'
    
    outputs:
    - id: results
      type: File
      outputBinding:
        glob: results.csv
    
    baseCommand:
    - python
    - calculation.py
    ```

When the tool is executed by a runner supporting containerization e.g. `cwltool` it is using the `pandas/pandas:pip-all` container to run the script in a reproducible environment.

## Building custom containers
Using a complex research environments a custom container is may needed. The same example from above will be executed in a container built from a `Dockerfile`.
This can be achieved by using the `-c` argument with a path to a `Dockerfile`. A tag can be specified by using `-t`.

    ```bash title="Command"
    s4n create -c Dockerfile -t my-docker python calculation.py --population population.csv --speakers speakers_revised.csv
    ```
    ```yaml title="calculation.cwl"
    #!/usr/bin/env cwl-runner
    
    cwlVersion: v1.2
    class: CommandLineTool
    
    requirements:
    - class: InitialWorkDirRequirement
      listing:
      - entryname: calculation.py
        entry:
          $include: '../../calculation.py'
    - class: DockerRequirement
      dockerFile:
        $include: '../../Dockerfile'
      dockerImageId: my-docker
    
    inputs:
    - id: population
      type: File
      default:
        class: File
        location: '../../population.csv'
      inputBinding:
        prefix: '--population'
    - id: speakers
      type: File
      default:
        class: File
        location: '../../speakers_revised.csv'
      inputBinding:
        prefix: '--speakers'
    
    outputs:
    - id: results
      type: File
      outputBinding:
        glob: results.csv
    
    baseCommand:
    - python
    - calculation.py
    
    ```
    ```docker title="Dockerfile"
    FROM python
    RUN pip install pandas
    ```

A runner will check whether a container with the specified image is existent and build it using the `Dockerfile` otherwise.
