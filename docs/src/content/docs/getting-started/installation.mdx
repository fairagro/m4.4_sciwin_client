## Shell completions
Shell completions can be generated by using the `s4n completions` command using the shell as a parameter. Valid shells are `bash`, `elvish`, `fish`, `powershell` and `zsh`.
The following command generates the completions script which can be executed using `source completions.sh`.
```bash
s4n completions bash > completions.sh
```
