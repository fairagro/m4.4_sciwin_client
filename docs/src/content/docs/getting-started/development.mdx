```
Furthermore a [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/) environment needs to be set up.

If VSCode is used as development environment the [rust-analyzer](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/languages/rust) extension needs to be installed.

### Build and test

SciWIn Client can than be build using the  `cargo` commandline tool
```bash
cargo build
```

To run & build `cargo run` can be used followed by the commands and parameters of SciWIn Client, e.g. `cargo run tool create python echo.py`.

For linting clippy is used which can be called using `cargo clippy --all-targets`

Unit and integration tests can be run using `cargo test`. If logging to stdout needs to be displayed the no-capture flag needs to be set `cargo test -- --nocapture`
